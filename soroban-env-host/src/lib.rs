//! This crate mainly exists to provide the Soroban [Host] type, which is the
//! _implementation_ of the [Env] interface between guest contract code and the
//! host it runs within.
//!
//! This crate also re-exports all of the content of the [soroban_env_common]
//! crate for use by host (or contract local-testing) code. Most of the type and
//! module definitions visible here are actually defined in the common crate.
//!
//! When unit-testing contracts natively (not using wasm), developers may also
//! wish to enable the `"testutils"` feature, which enables an interface on
//! [Host] for registering other test contracts by ID.
//!
//! The [Host] type provides some facilities above and beyond just the [Env]
//! trait, including:
//!
//!   - The [budget] module which is responsible for measuring and limiting
//!     execution costs in terms of CPU and memory.
//!   - The [storage] module which is responsible for providing an interface
//!     between contracts and their durable storage.
