/// PRNG subsystem in the host, which provides best-effort pseudo-randomness to
/// guest contracts using a combination of features that guests cannot easily
/// implement themselves:
///
///   - The host itself maintains one "base" PRNG which should be seeded by the
///     embedding environment and should be different for each host instance, or
///     roughly "each transaction in a block of transactions" so that
///     transactions from different submitters cannot guess one another's seeds.
///     It is the embedder's responsibility to set this to something hard to
///     predict. In the stellar-core embedding, S is set to the combination of
///     the txset hash and the apply-order _position_ of the transaction in the
///     txset, which is itself defined in terms of an xor of each transaction
///     hash and the previous ledger hash. While it is theoretically possible
///     for a validator to guess or influence this, being able to do so also
///     grants validators the ability to front-run the orderbook and is
///     therefore already an attack vector for the whole stellar network's
///     financial integrity. In other words: reusing it here doesn't make
///     anything worse, we're already obliged to make transaction apply-order
///     hard to guess or control.
///
///   - Each frame (which is to say: each contract invocation or sub-invocation)
///     will get a new PRNG instance separately seeded from the host's "base"
///     PRNG, and guest code can only access the frame's PRNG, not the "base"
///     PRNG or those of any other frame. This doesn't eliminate _all_ attack
///     vectors or mechanisms for misuse, but it's the best we can give the user
///     for buiding on. In particular it means that a "random" contract will not
///     behave the same way from one call to the next inside the same txset, nor
///     can a caller control the seed for a "random" callee (since they can't
///     observe the state of the "base" PRNG).
///
///   - Users _can_ reseed their frame-local PRNG if they want, which is a
///     useful building block for random-commitment schemes. In particular if a
///     contract is trying to make a "single random decision", and avoid having
///     callers retry that decision repeatedly while aborting the transaction on
///     any random decision the caller doesn't like, the contract can operate as
///     a state machine like so:
///
///       - tx1: write commitment finalizing all inputs to "random action", plus
///              N = current ledger and S = prng_new_bytes(32).
///
///       - tx2: re-read all committed values, if ledger > N, prng_reseed(S),
///              and use PRNG to take "random" action committed-to.
///
///     With this design, assuming the contract does not expose any _online_
///     method for its caller to observe the commitment it made in tx1, the
///     caller (situated in the same transaction) won't know from its position
///     whether it's to its advantage or not to abort tx1, so will naturally let
///     it commit. Once the commitment is saved, it includes a "locked in"
///     choice of seed, essentially propagating PRNG state out of a context the
///     caller might have been able to influence its state via selective aborts
///     (but didn't know whether to) into a context where the caller can no
///     longer influence its state. The contract can then be re-invoked in the
///     next ledger to load and execute the commitment, in tx2.
///
///   - We also include 3 building blocks for _using_ the PRNG: one basic one
///     that just "generates a random BytesObject" (that the user can do
///     anything they like with, including copying to guest linear memory), and
///     two slightly more subtle but very standard operations that are easy to
///     get wrong: an inclusive-range uniform u64 sampler and a Fisher-Yates
///     vector shuffle. The latter is also hard to do cheaply in guest code
///     without copying the vector into the guest and copying it back.
///
///   - All these PRNGs are ChaCha20: a strong, cheap, standard CSPRNG.
