# This feature guards the work-in-progress changes in soroban-env-host
# API. Its main purpose is to be able to make API changes without bumping
# the crate version.
# These changes should only be used by importers who depend on
# an exact patch version of the crates in this repo, because breaking
# changes may be introduced into any version in any code gated by
# this feature.
# When bumping the major version of any crates in this repo all the code
# guarded by this feature should be enabled unconditionally.
