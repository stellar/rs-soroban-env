# This file defines a workspace that is _periodically_ recompiled as part of
# updating the WASM files that are then embedded as as bytes constants in the
# surrounding crate `soroban-test-wasms`.
#
# Neither the rust crates in this workspace, nor the workspace itself, are (in
# cargo's mind) part of the outer workspace containing
# soroban-env-{host,guest,macros,wasm-tests} etc. The inner workspace is
# excluded from the outer workspace, and the crates within it must be manually
# built (and should only be built as WASM). See the adjacent `Makefile` for
# invocation.
#
# The dependency graph here is complex and subtle and needs to be understood if
# you're going to use it correctly. There is further explanation in
# https://rs-soroban-env/soroban-test-wasms/README.md
