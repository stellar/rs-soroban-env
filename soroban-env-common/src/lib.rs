#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]
//! The environment-common crate contains three families of types:
//!
//!   - The [Val] type, a 64-bit value type that is a union between several
//!     different types (numbers, booleans, symbols, object references), encoded
//!     via careful bit-packing.
//!   - Wrapper types ([Object], [Symbol], [Error]) that
//!     contain [Val] in a specific, known union state. These are also 64-bit
//!     values, but offer methods specific to the union state (eg. [Symbol] will
//!     interconvert with Rust strings).
//!   - The [Env] trait, which describes the _interface_ between guest and host
//!     code. In other words, `Env` describes a set of _host functions_ that
//!     must be implemented in a contract host, and can be called from a guest
//!     (or by the SDK). Methods on the [Env] trait can only pass 64-bit values,
//!     which are usually [Val] or one of the wrapper types.
//!
//! The crate additionally contains functions for interconversion between the
//! [Val] type and XDR types, and re-exports the XDR definitions from
//! [stellar_xdr] under the module [xdr].
