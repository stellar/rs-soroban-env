//! This module contains "expressions": a recursive datatype that describes
//! well-formed (and well-typed) program fragments we can translate to WASM
//! using the [`FuncEmitter`] interface.
//!
//! Each expresison type in this module implements the [`Emit`] trait that
//! generates some WASM code (depending on the expression type and variant) and
//! returns a weakly-typed [`Operand`], which can in turn be used as an input to
//! code emitting any enclosing expression. The higher-level [`Val`] type that
//! each such [`Operand`] actually encodes depends on the expression type. For
//! example the [`Operand`]s returned from emitting any [`MapExpr`] will encode
//! an object handle with tag [`Tag::MapObject`].
//!
//! Despite the fact that WASM is loosely-speaking "a stack machine", for a
//! couple different reasons when generating code here we have each expression
//! leave _nothing_ on the WASM stack, instead storing its result to a local and
//! returning a [`LocalRef`] to it. This both fits other parts of the code
//! generation interface better and allows us to recycle locals by type between
//! expressions without having to model or shuffle the stack.
//!
//! The expression types exist partly to facilitate higher-level code generation
//! but mostly so that the fuzzer can derive and generate [`Arbitrary`]
//! instances of them, as concrete datatypes fed to a fuzz target.
