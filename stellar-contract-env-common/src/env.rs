/// X-macro definition
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// The set of host functions need to be statically reflected-on in a variety of
// contexts (both in this crate and elsewhere in the guest and host crates), so
// we define them through an x-macro (a macro that calls a user-provided macro)
// and call the x-macro from all such contexts.
//
// How this macro works:
//  - It exports a higher-order "x-macro" called
//    call_macro_with_all_host_functions
//  - The x-macro takes the name of some callback macro to call
//  - The x-macro invokes the callback macro once, passing a single large token
//    tree, seen below in the body of the x-macro
//
// To use this macro:
//  - Call sites define a callback macro that matches on the token-tree
//  - Call sites invoke the x-macro passing their callback macro name
//
// The token-tree being passed is arbitrary, but is chosen to satisfy 3
// criteria:
//  - It's relatively easy to read, edit and understand its content
//  - It's easy to decompose with pattern-matching in the callback macros
//  - It contains everything any callback macro wants to match and use
//
// All callback macros have essentially the same token-tree matcher part,
// only their expansion parts differ.
